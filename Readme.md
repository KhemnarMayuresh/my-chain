# My Chain
In this project I have created a blockchain and cryptocurrency from scratch. I use NodeJS to implement this project.

In this implementation I have use main blockchain concepts like Proof-of-Work, mining, peer-to-peer connections, etc.
Created a NodeJS application with real-time websocket connections. which created an API with NodeJS and Express for my blockchain.

Project mainly contain following:
- Build a Blockchain in the object-oriented programming style.
- Generate hashes for blocks in the chain.
- Unit Test Components of the Blockchain.
- Create an API around the Blockchain.
- Create a real-time connected peer-to-peer server.
- Implement a proof-of-work algorithm.
- Sign Transactions with cryptography and digital signature.
- Create a Transaction Pool for a real-time list of incoming data.
- Include transactions in core blocks of the chain.
